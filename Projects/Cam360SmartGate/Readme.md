This project involves building an object detection system using a 360° camera with 4K resolution, streaming via RTSP, for real-time monitoring and control at a security checkpoint. The system identifies people, their actions, and specific characteristics such as the color of their clothes, and communicates with external hardware via RS232. It provides predictions on the stream, saves them into a database, and logs the events. The system also broadcasts video to the frontend and interacts with external systems for real-time data access and updates.

PART 3: CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS:
=================================

**1. **Technical Challenges
---------------------------

### 1.1. Accuracy in Clothing Recognition

-   **Challenge:**\
    The system achieves 98% accuracy for trained scenarios. However, it struggles with edge cases where clothing closely resembles the approved colors (e.g., blue or black) but is not compliant due to design or texture. The AI model currently relies solely on shape and color, which leads to misclassification when both factors align (e.g., matching design and color but similaring or differing fabric types).
-   **Proposed Solution:**

-   Expanding labeled data to include subtle distinctions in clothing styles or textures.
-   Adjusting the labeled regions to emphasize unique features that differentiate compliant and non-compliant clothing.
-   Incorporating additional input features (e.g., fabric reflectivity or texture analysis) to distinguish similar designs or colors.

-   **Limitation:**\
    The system cannot fully differentiate between identical colors and designs with different fabric types.

### 1.2. Lighting Conditions

-   **Challenge:**\
    Inconsistent lighting in the checkpoint passage (e.g., shadowy areas, glare, or dim light) adversely affects image quality, reducing detection accuracy and leading to false positives or negatives.
-   **Proposed Solutions:**

1.  **Physical Lighting Improvements:**

-   Installing additional light sources to improve illumination uniformity.
-   Adjusting light placement to reduce glare and shadowing, resulting in higher quality raw images.

3.  **Data Collection and Retraining:**

-   Collecting extensive datasets across diverse lighting conditions.
-   Annotating and retraining the model iteratively, with over 20 versions trained to date, gradually improving performance.

### 1.3. Processing Speed and System Latency

-   **Challenge:**\
    The system operates with a single GPU, which must handle high-resolution video processing and complex algorithms such as object detection, pose estimation, and color classification. This constraint leads to slower processing speeds and delays in decision-making.
-   **Proposed Solutions:**

1.  **Algorithm Optimization:**

-   Streamlining the detection pipeline to remove computational bottlenecks.
-   Replacing slower algorithms with simplified alternatives that maintain acceptable accuracy.

3.  **Model Selection Trade-Off:**

-   Selecting lighter models that offer faster inference times, even at a slight cost to detection accuracy (within acceptable tolerances).
-   Balancing the trade-off between speed and accuracy to ensure real-time system responsiveness.

**2. **Solutions Implemented
----------------------------

### 2.1. Data Collection and Expansion

**Data Acquisition:**

-   Collecting real-world data from diverse scenarios to improve model generalization.
-   Scenarios include:

-   Different lighting conditions (e.g., natural light, shadows, low light).
-   Variations in clothing styles, colors, and movements.
-   Edge cases, such as overlapping objects or partially obscured individuals.

**Annotation and Iterative Training:**

-   Carefully annotating data to ensure high-quality labels for training.
-   Training the model iteratively with over 20 versions to gradually refine accuracy and address previously undetected scenarios.
-   Testing each version against real-world conditions to identify weaknesses and improve model robustness.

### 2.2. System Adaptation Using Data

**Internal Data Coverage:**

-   Leveraging internal data collected from the deployment site to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible edge cases.
-   Incorporating data from multiple environments and operational conditions to build a diverse dataset.

**Continuous Model Updating:**

-   Regularly updating the model with newly acquired data to adapt to evolving scenarios.
-   Testing updates in a controlled environment to verify performance improvements before full deployment.

### 2.3. Algorithm Improvement

-   **Training Data Enhancement:**

-   Incorporating a diverse dataset with various lighting conditions, clothing colors, and edge cases.
-   Applying data augmentation techniques, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, and color saturation, to simulate real-world variations.

-   **Focus on Robustness:**

-   Fine-tuning YOLOv8's training for challenging scenarios, such as overlapping colors and objects in motion.
-   Exploring advanced algorithms for color classification that can accommodate subtle lighting shifts.

### 2.4. System Configuration Adjustments

-   **Threshold Calibration:**

-   Adjusting algorithm thresholds for specific environmental conditions to reduce false positives or negatives.
-   Configuring OK/NG decision parameters based on the operational context (e.g., stricter criteria for critical zones).

PART 4: RESULTS ACHIEVED
========================

**1. ****Accuracy in Recognition**
----------------------------------

-   The system achieves an impressive **98% accuracy** in detecting and classifying objects, actions, and clothing colors. This exceeds the initial project requirements outlined in the Esign document (requirements 96%), demonstrating exceptional reliability and precision in recognition tasks.

**2. ****Processing Speed**
---------------------------

-   The system operates at a **processing speed of 25 FPS ****(Frames Per Second)****,** ensuring seamless real-time monitoring. This performance confirms the system's capability to analyze high-resolution video streams and make decisions promptly to meet the demands of access control scenarios.

**3. ****Error Rate**
---------------------

-   The **error rate is 2%**, primarily due to edge cases involving blue and black clothing that match the color and style of company uniforms. These cases remain challenging as the system cannot differentiate based on fabric type, though efforts have been made to minimize such occurrences.
